# Working Backwards PartyRock App

The "Working Backwards" methodology is a product development approach used by Amazon and AWS that begins with the end goal in mind: the customer experience. This process involves starting with a clear definition of the customer problem and envisioning the ideal solution before any development work begins. The key elements include writing a mock press release and FAQ (PR/FAQ) document that outlines the product as if it has already been launched, emphasizing customer benefits and usability.

## What is a PR/FAQ document?

The PR/FAQ document is a strategic artifact that ensures product development remains focused on delivering clear value to customers, aligning with business goals, and facilitating transparent communication across teams.

A PR/FAQ document is a tool to develop new ideas and products. The acronym stands for "Press Release/Frequently Asked Questions," and the document is designed to clarify and crystallize the vision of a new product or feature as if it is already released.

## How does this app help me?

a) **guide** you through the process by answering five key customer questions, along with providing context about your company and the product you want to build.

b) **generate** a press release draft to save you tons of time. Consider this as a starting point for your initial PR/FAQ review. Feel free to fine-tune it before.

Once provided all required information, just hit CMD/CTRL + ENTER to start the creation of the press release.

The app not only creates an initial draft of the press release but also a list of FAQs that you should answer for yourself and for your customers.

The Press Release Checklist provides you feedback about important aspects of your press release draft by answering the following questions:

Is it clear who the customer is?
Does it clearly state the problem or opportunity that exists?
Is the most important benefit clear?
Does it paint a compelling picture of what the new solution is?
Does the customer testimonial reinforce the value?
Can you visualize the customer experience?
