Blue Corp. Announces the Launch of Melinda, the Smart Mailbox.

Melinda is the physical mailbox designed to securely receive and keep safe all your e-commerce and grocery deliveries.

Newswire, Atlanta, GA, November 5, 2019 - Today Blue Corp. announced the launch of Melinda, a smart mailbox that ensures secure and properly chilled delivery and storage for your online purchases and groceries. With Melinda, you no longer need to worry about getting your deliveries stolen from your doorstep or spoiled groceries. Plus, you‚Äôre notified as soon as your packages are delivered. Packed with smart technology, Melinda costs just $299.

Today, 23 percent of online shoppers report having packages stolen from their front porch, and 19 percent complain of grocery deliveries being spoiled. With no easy solution to these problems, customers give up and stop ordering online.

Melinda, with its smart technology and insulation, makes stolen packages and spoiled groceries a thing of the past. Each Melinda includes a camera and a speaker. When a delivery courier arrives at your home, Melinda tells the courier to scan the package barcode by holding it up to the camera. If the code is valid, the front door opens and Melinda instructs the courier to place the package inside and close the door securely. The built-in scale in the base of each Melinda verifies that the weight of the delivery matches the weight of the item(s) you ordered. The courier receives a voice confirmation, and your purchase is safe and secure. Melinda sends you a text letting you know that your item arrived along with a video of the courier making the delivery. 
When you return home and are ready to retrieve your delivery, just use the built-in fingerprint reader to unlock the door. Melinda can store and recognize up to ten saved fingerprints so that all members of your family can access Melinda.

Do you use Instacart, Amazon, or Walmart for online grocery delivery? If so, are you tired of spoiled groceries in the hot sun? Melinda keeps your chilled and frozen food cold. 

The walls of Melinda are two inches thick and made with the same pressure-injected foam used in the best coolers, keeping your groceries cool for up to twelve hours. Melinda fits easily on your porch or stoop, taking up just a few feet of space, and you can choose from a variety of colors and finishes to make Melinda an attractive addition to the appearance of your home. 

‚ÄúMelinda is a breakthrough in safety and convenience for online shoppers,‚Äù says Lisa Morris, CEO of Blue Corp. ‚ÄúIn creating Melinda we combined a number of the latest technologies at the low price of just $299.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMelinda is a lifesaver,‚Äù said Janet Thomas, a frequent online shopper and customer of Instacart. ‚ÄúIt is so frustrating when one of my packages is stolen from my front porch, and it can be time-consuming to work with customer support to get a refund. I use Instacart every week for grocery delivery, and many times I am not home when my groceries arrive. I love knowing that they are kept cool and secure in my Melinda. I selected the natural teak finish for my Melinda‚Äîit looks great on my front porch.‚Äù

To order your Melinda, simply visit keepitcoolmelinda.com, or visit amazon.com, walmart.com, Walmart stores, and other leading retailers.
